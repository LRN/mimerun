Mimerun consists of the following:
 * MimeRun Shell Hook (libmimerunshook)
 * Commandline bridge to the hook (cmdrun)
 * Installer/uninstaller (mimerunreg)

 Mimerun installs itself as a shell hook (shell hooks are supported in all
versions of Windows since Windows XP, although they are disabled in Vista
and later by default). Whenever something (Windows Explorer, Windows command
line shell, or any Windows program) calls ShellExecute() or ShellExecuteEx(),
Mimerun catches that and, if target is a file, uses libmagic (the supporting
library if the UNIX file(1) utility) to guess the type of target. Then it
compares the result of type guessing with a set of Mimerun rules (written by
user, stored in the registry) and, if a match is found, executes the command
specified in the matching rule. Once a matching rule is found and its handler
is executed successfully, Mimerun signals the caller of that success, stopping
the shell from trying to handle the target. If no rules match, or the target
is not a file, or if there were errors during the computation, Mimerun signals
a failure and lets the shell find other ways to handle the target.
 Mimerun also supports shebangs, being able to use them exclusively to run
scripts with correct interpreters, or supplementing a handler with them.
 Commandline bridge is used to force the shell to pass any unknown files (files
that do not match any of the shell's own file associations) to Mimerun. This
allows Mimerun to process files that were double-clicked in Windows Explorer
and were not handled by the shell.
 Adding "." to PATHEXT environment variable allows files without extensions
to be handled correctly.

=========== BUILDING ===========

 Build requirements:
  * MinGW or MinGW-W64 toolchain
  * win32api MinGW package
  * libmagic (from file(1) package)
  * libgnurx
  * GNU make

 MSys (or a cross-compiling toolchain on *nix) is necessary to build libmagic
(and build libgnurx for x64, since MinGW provides binaries only for x86), but
Mimerun itself can be built without MSys.

 Makefile is located in ./build subdirectory.
 Two scripts - compile_x86 and compile_x64 are provided as examples of how to
invoke the makefile.

=========== INSTALLING ===========

 The same makefile is used to install mimerun into target directory. Invoke its
install target. For example:
    make install DESTDIR=c:\mimerun
DESTDIR definition is mandatory for install target.

 After that run, for example:
    c:\mimerun\<architecture>\mimrunreg.exe --register local_machine
to put the necessary keys into the registry. Architecture can be
x86 (for 32-bit OS) or x64 (for 64-bit OS).

 mimerunreg will not modify PATHEXT.
 mimerunreg will register libmimerunshook COM library, enable shell hooks,
add cmdrun handler for Unknown, and create two example rules in
